# Welcome

Hi, there. It appears you've stumbled upon my website.

I am a Software Engineer from Sweden, currently working as a Solution Architect at Securitas Intelligent Services.

For the past few years, my focus has been to deliver Machine Learning solutions in a Cloud Native fashion. This has brought me down the path of learning Go, which is now my primary and favourite programming language.

I post articles here and on [Medium](https://medium.com/@seb.nyberg).

For any questions, reach out to me via [Email](mailto:seb.nyberg90@gmail.com) or on [Twitter](https://www.twitter.com/seb_nyberg).
