I am Sebastian Nyberg, a Software Engineer from Sweden, currently living in Malm√∂, Sweden.

Ever since I was a kid, I've been hooked on everything related to computers and mathematics. The first program I wrote was in BASIC (good choice, looking back at it) around age 11. I quickly got into building websites, then entered a number of blunder years with ActionScript and doing Flash animations - effectively creating the most horrific website experience imaginable.

During my MSc at university, I found an interest in Machine Learning. Since then, I've been working on the delivery of Machine Learning solutions.

In so far as it is possible, I focus on the composition of tools rather than implementation. For this reason, I've moved towards the Cloud Native space - the world of container infrastructure. Naturally, Go has become my primary and favourite language.

My future vision is to make a difference in technology. To not just be a consumer and producer of derivatives, but an author and maintainer as well.

Thank you for visiting this website.
