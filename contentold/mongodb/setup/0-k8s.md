Assuming that you have [Helm](https://helm.sh/) installed, there are two charts of interest:

* [stable/mongodb](https://github.com/helm/charts/tree/master/stable/mongodb)
* [stable/mongodb-replicaset](https://github.com/helm/charts/tree/master/stable/mongodb-replicaset)

For most use cases, especially if you are starting out with MongoDB, it makes sense to go for the first one. Once you are familiar with- and there's a need for replica sets, switch to the second one.

Install with

```bash
helm install stable/mongodb
```

or

```bash
RELEASE_NAME=my-mongodb

helm repo add stable https://kubernetes-charts.storage.googleapis.com/
helm install --name $RELEASE_NAME stable/mongodb-replicaset
```

Give the installation a while then check pod status:

```bash
kubectl get pods
```

By default, the replicaset will choose the first node as the master.

### Local development

For testing purposes, you can run a local port-forward to the mongodb pod and access it via localhost:

```bash
first_mongo_pod=$(kubectl get pods | awk '$1 ~ /mongo/ { print $1; exit }')
kubectl port-forward $first_mongo_pod 27017:27017
```

{{% notice note %}}
In case you are new to awk, awk will traverse each row of the `kubectl get pods` command and store each field in $i, i > 0. If the first field contains the word "mongo", the statement within curly braces will be executed, and the `exit` command will stop further execution.
{{% /notice%}}

You can now connect to the database with Mongo Shell locally:

```bash
$ mongo
MongoDB shell version v4.0.5
