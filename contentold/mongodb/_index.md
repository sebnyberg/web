### MongoDB

# Notes and guides

This section contains some notes and guides on how to use MongoDB. For anyone starting out, I highly recommend taking [Maximilian Schwarzm√ºller](https://www.udemy.com/user/academind/)'s course on Udemy - it is worth paying for. In fact, if you come across a course in a field you wish to learn where Max is the mentor, you are in luck.
