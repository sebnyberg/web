I'm an engineer primarily based in Sweden doing remote work from less cold places when winter hits.

Leveraging new technology to solve previously unsolved problems is my passion in life. Although my primary interest lies with buildling cloud-native solutions and APIs, I have also spent my fair share of time doing full-stack development.

When I'm not coding, I'm eating or sleeping.
